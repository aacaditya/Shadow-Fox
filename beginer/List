#  a. You have a list of superheroes representing the Justice
#     League. justice_league = ["Superman", "Batman", "Wonder
#     Woman", "Flash", "Aquaman", "Green Lantern"] 
#     Perform the following tasks: 
#     1. Calculate the number of members in the Justice League.
#     2. Batman recruited Batgirl and Nightwing as new members.
#      Add them to your list. 
#     3. Wonder Woman is now the leader of the Justice League.
#      Move her to the beginning of the list. 
#     4. Aquaman and Flash are having conflicts, and you need to
#      separate them. Choose either "Green Lantern" or "Superman"
#      and move them in between Aquaman and Flash. 
#     5. The Justice League faced a crisis, and Superman decided to
#      assemble a new team. Replace the existing list with the following
#      new members: "Cyborg", "Shazam", "Hawkgirl", "Martian
#      Manhunter", "Green Arrow". 
#     6. Sort the Justice League alphabetically. The hero at the 0th
#      index will become the new leader. 

#      Your task is to write Python code to perform these operations on
#      the "justice_league" list. Display the list at each step to observe
#      the changes.
