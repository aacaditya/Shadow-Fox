# 1. create a variable named pi and store the value 22/7 in it.Now check the data type of this variable.
pi=22/7
print(type(pi))

# 2. Create a variable called for and assign it a value 4. See what happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you see. 
for=4
print(for)
# if i create variable for and assign value 4 and then print then i will got syntax error:invalid syntax


# 3. Store the principal amount, rate of interest, and time in different variables and then calculate the Simple Interest for 3years. Formula: Simple Interest = P x R x T / 100
P = 10000 #principle interest
R = 5     #Rate of interest
T = 3     #Time (in year)

SI=(P * R * T) / 100  #simple interest

print("Simple Interest:",SI)
