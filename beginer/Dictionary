#    For example, if someoneâ€™s name is Aditya, the tuple would be: ('Aditya', 6)

# 2.You and your partner are planning a trip, and you want to track expenses.
#   Create two dictionaries, one for your expenses and one for your partner's
#   expenses. Each dictionary should contain at least 5 expense categories and their
#   corresponding amounts.
#   For example: 
#  Your expenses 
#  your_expenses = { 
#  "Hotel": 1200, 
#  "Food": 800, 
#  "Transportation": 500, 
#  "Attractions": 300,

#  } 
#  Your partner's expenses 
#  partner_expenses = { 
#  "Hotel": 1000, 
#  "Food": 900, 
#  "Transportation": 600, 
#  "Attractions": 400, 
#  "Miscellaneous": 150 
#  }
#   Calculate the total expenses for each of you and print the results. 
#  Determine who spent more money overall and print the result. 
#  Find out the expense category where there is a significant difference in spending
#   between you and your partner. 
#  Print the category and the difference.
